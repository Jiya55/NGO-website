     	 <H1>Lunch for only Rs 5, cooked & served with love</H1>
      <p class="para">
India is home to 25 per cent of the world's hungry population. The Global Hunger Index ranks us at 
97 out of 118, while Rs 58,000 crore
 worth of food is wasted. Even as these facts stare us in the face, most of us are inured to the issue of hunger. 
Devdoot Food Club is a 
not-for-profit social enterprise which aims to solve the problem of hunger and malnutrition in the country.They provide nutritious meals to poor people made with love and hygiene for a mere Rs 5 — which is more ‘subsidised’ than even a government-run cafeteria.
There are many people who don’t have enough money to buy food, so Pankaj Gupta from Devdoot food club wanted to do something for them. Devdoot Food Club didn’t just want to distribute the food for free But instead, Their work is based on the ideology that If people pay nominally for their meals, it will have a sense of respect attached,  and hence encourage them to come back again and eat with dignity.
The food is prepared in their kitchen at Sadar Bazaar, gurugram. Preparation of the food starts early in the morning. They make sure that all seven days the food is different. So, the menu would consist of dal-chawal, rajma, choley, kadi, sabzi, roti and pickle. However the School kids and other children who come to eat get the meal for Free .
Be it a rickshaw puller, shop owner or just a passer-by, people from all walks of life queue up at the stall for lunch from Monday to Sunday, between 12pm and 2pm, Devdoot Food Club serves inexpensive lunch cooked and served with love.
